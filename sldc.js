// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "Finding the business requirments. Such as how the product should work and who will be using it."
const design = "Based off the requirements decide hardware and system requirements, and defining the overall system architecture to meet requirements."
const implementaion = "This is the actual coding of the project. This is the main focus of developers and should be built based off the past two steps."
const testingAndIntegration = "After code is finished it is tested to ensure it is working and accomplishes all requirements that were specified."
const maintain = "Once the finished product is delivered, problems and feature request may come up that need addressed by developers."
